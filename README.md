DSA-MiniSQL: A SQL-Like Command-Line Interface

Project Overview

DSA-MiniSQL is a command-line interface (CLI) application that mimics SQL-like operations to interact with an in-memory database. This project is built using Java and the Picocli library. The CLI allows users to perform basic database operations such as inserting, searching, and deleting records using SQL-like statements.

Features

	•	Insert records using INSERT INTO.
	•	Search records using SELECT * FROM.
	•	Delete records using DELETE FROM.
	•	Interactive CLI for user input, similar to SQL shell.
	•	In-memory database implementation for simplicity.

Technologies Used

	•	Java: The core programming language.
	•	Maven: Build automation tool used for dependency management and project structure.
	•	Picocli: A powerful library for building command-line interfaces in Java.
	•	JUnit: For testing purposes (if applicable).
